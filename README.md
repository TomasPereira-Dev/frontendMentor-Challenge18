# Feedback App  
This project is part of Frontend Mentor's catalog of ideas.  
The original goal was to (based only in a few static images) do a CRUD app to give feedback.  
The users can post, edit and delete suggestions, add comments and reply to them and give upvotes.  

## Plans for the future  
I want to store all the data into mySQL instead of a JSON, to make use of it I need to learn how to use Node.js and some of the basics of backend development.  
I expect it to be done in July this year, 2 weeks from now, but because it's something i've never done it might took me longer.
